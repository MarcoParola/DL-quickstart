# **Thesis document writing**
This section provides a brief guide to the structure and guidelines for writing the thesis document. You can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as collaborative LaTeX editor sharing the project with the institutional mail of your supervisor to ensure efficient collaboration, feedback, and supervision throughout the writing process. If you're new to Overleaf, you can create a new project from scratch or use an existing template like [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-tesi-universita-di-pisa/xwjmznxbtszd) as a starting point. 

> **_NOTE:_** the document must be written in English

7. **Experiments and Results**
   - Presentation of research experiments and the obtained results.
   - Use of graphs, tables, or other visual aids if necessary.

## **Citations**
